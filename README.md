# VBA Challenge 

## Overview of Project
  The VBA Challenge project gives an analysis of 2017 and 2018 stocks based on yearly returns and the trade volume totals per year.
### Purpose
  The Purpose of the VBA challenge was to experiment with refactoing code. In the module tasks leading up to the challenge I had made a fully functional version of the VBA challenge, but now it needs to be made more effiecent. 
## Analysis and Challenges
  The VBA challenge shows the total volume and yearly return for 12 stocks in both 2017 and 2018. The analysis that you can take from that is really up to what kind of investor you are. If you want to invest in stocks with high returns hoping to continue those high return then you would want to invest in the highest percentage of annual returns per year. If you are wanting to invest in stocks who have lost value hoping that they regain value then invest in stocks who had negitive annual returns. The challenges in refactoring code for me were working with the for loops, arrays, and if statements. 
## Advantages and Disadvantages of Refactoring Code in General
  An advantage of refactoring code for me at this point in my learning progress was to reinforce concepts. Another benefit was cleaing up the design of the code so it is more readable and efficent. The code all was able to run much faster. A disadvantage for me from a practical stand point was it took several hours to get the same output, so in my opinion I do not think that it was worth the amount of time put into it. 
## Advantages and Disadvantages of the Original and Refactored VBA Script 
 An advantage of the orinal script was I was able to complete the original script much faster than the refactored script. A disadvantage of the original script was without the added arrays the amount of stocks that can be analized could be limited.
